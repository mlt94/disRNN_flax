# disRNN
Upon cloning this repo, make sure to set the `--recursive-submodules` flag, as I am referencing the (original disentangled_rnns implementation)[https://github.com/google-deepmind/disentangled_rnns/tree/main] as a submodule.
If you already cloned it, use `git submodule update --init --recursive`


# Installation
I rely on the same environment installation as the original repo, though remember to `pip install -U flax`.
